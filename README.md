# mememe-v1.0
MemeMe is a universal iOS app that I created in Swift for a project in the Udacity nanodegree program. This is the first version of the app.

## Specifications
MemeMe allows a user to create a meme, then to share it socially. The user picks an image from the camera or photo album, and inputs text at the top and bottom of the image.
