# mememe-v1.0
MemeMe is a universal iOS app that I created in Swift for a project in the Udacity nanodegree program. This is the first version of the app.

## Specifications
MemeMe allows a user to create a meme, then to share it socially. The user picks an image from the camera or photo album, and inputs text at the top and bottom of the image. Here are some features included in the app:
- Autolayout constraints set for this universal app that runs in portrait and landscape orientation
- The view moves above the keyboard when editing the bottom text field, then it moves back down after editing
- Images are selected via the image picker controller
- Tap and swipe gesture recognizers implemented to dismiss the keyboard 
- Popovers implemented on iPad
- Sharing implemented via an activity view controller
